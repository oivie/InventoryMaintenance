# Inventory Management System

This repository contains a simple Inventory Management System implemented in C#. It showcases object-oriented programming, file I/O operations using binary files, and basic CRUD operations within a Windows Forms application.

## Description

The Inventory Management System is a Windows Forms application that allows users to add, delete, and view inventory items. The application utilizes a binary file (`InventoryItems.dat`) to persistently store inventory data across sessions.

## Features

- **Add New Inventory Item:** Users can input an item number, description, and price to add a new inventory item to the list.
- **Delete Inventory Item:** Users can select an item from the list and delete it.
- **View Inventory Items:** Users can view a list of all inventory items loaded from the binary data file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`InventoryMaintenance.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to resolve dependencies and compile the project.
4. Run the application within Visual Studio or navigate to the `bin\Debug` directory and launch the `InventoryMaintenance.exe` executable file.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a list of inventory items retrieved from the binary data file. You can add new items or delete existing ones using the form controls.
